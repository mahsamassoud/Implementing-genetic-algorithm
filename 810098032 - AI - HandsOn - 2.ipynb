    "# HandsOn2 - game\n",
    "## Mahsa Massoud - 810098032\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we create an agent that plays blackjack with another agent in a deterministic environment. the algorithm used for finding agent's best decisions is MiniMax. We play with basic minimax algorithm and also with a method called Alpha-Beta Pruning to speed up search and prune search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "a boolean parameter which called prune is added tu the Blackjack class inorder to prevent duplication in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "starting from current state as a Max node ,we try to maximize player's expected reward. we check all possible moves and with enlisting the help of heuristic function , we check whether any of player or component have won. then we pass game to next level of tree where is a Min level. in Min nodes we simulate reverse the roll of opoonent and player moves by trying to minimize game's result as -1 is win for opponent and 1 is win for player. this tree continues to grow to leafs where two players has stopped. each leaf is a final state of game , which is implemented in the check_for_winners methd,and then we backtrack to parent nodes.\n",
    "for assigning suitable heuristic , we calculate the distance of player and opponent to the limit of 41. if any pass this bond, a coefficient which its absoulte value is high(100) will be multiplied to the difference between sum of the current cards and the target. eventually it will be added to the heuristic value and returned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 - \n",
    "No we can't use the min max directly but we can use a modified version which is Expectimax and use the probability of outcomes and use expected values to determine which move should we take.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2,3 - \n",
    "\n",
    "in this game with some observations on different strategies, I find out that in each state starting with erasing cards from agents deck or opponent's deck is better than drawing card from game's deck and also drawing card is more better than stopping. the intuition behind this strategy is that stopping too early can give your opponent chance to remove card from your deck and at the same time opponent can draw card so it results in increase of opponents score and decreasing your score. also drawing cards can be dangerous as number of your remaining erases decreases and we get closer to end of game, drawing cards has risk of surpasing the limited 41 score."
